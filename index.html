  Wenhao Fang is a 10th-grade student at Canyon Crest Academy with a passion for swimming. As a dedicated swimmer, he is eager to share his expertise with younger children, helping them master the four main strokes: freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly. Wenhao believes that proper technique is the key to becoming a stronger swimmer and enjoys breaking down each stroke into manageable steps, allowing kids to build confidence and improve their skills in the water.

  <p style="font-size:2vw;">Wenhao Fang, a 10th-grade student at <a href="https://cc.sduhsd.net/"> Canyon Crest Academy</a>, has been passionate about swimming since he started at the age of 6. 
    He has competed with swimming clubs in both Houston and San Diego and is currently a member of <a href="https://www.gomotionapp.com/team/lfjccst/page/home"> the J-Barracuda team </a> in San Diego, where he continues to 
    swim competitively. Wenhao, who excels in freestyle and butterfly, was a championship swimmer during his time at Penn Oak Middle School. Now, he is eager 
    to share his expertise with younger children, helping them master the four main strokes: freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly. He believes 
    that proper technique is the key to becoming a stronger swimmer and enjoys breaking down each stroke into manageable steps, allowing kids to build confidence 
    and improve their skills in the water.

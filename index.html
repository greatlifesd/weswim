  <p style="font-size:2vw;"> I am Wenhao Fang, a 10th-grade student at <a href="https://cc.sduhsd.net/"> Canyon Crest Academy</a>. I have been passionate about swimming since I started at the age of 6. 
    I have competed with swimming clubs in both Houston and San Diego and is currently a member of <a href="https://www.gomotionapp.com/team/lfjccst/page/home"> the J-Barracuda team </a> in San Diego, where I continues to 
    swim competitively. I, who excels in freestyle and butterfly, was a championship swimmer during my time at <a href="https://www.houstonisd.org/PinOak"> Pin Oak Middle School </a> in Houston. This summer (2024), I and my sister Emily Fang founded the <i><b>WeSwim swimming team</b></i>, with the name derived from the first letters of our names.
    I am eager to share my expertise with younger children, helping them master the four main strokes: freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly. I believe 
    that proper technique is the key to becoming a stronger swimmer and enjoys breaking down each stroke into manageable steps, allowing kids to build confidence 
    and improve their skills in the water.

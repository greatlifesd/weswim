  <p style="font-size:2.5vw;">Wenhao Fang is a 10th-grade student at Canyon Crest Academy with a passion for swimming. 
    As a dedicated swimmer, he is eager to share his expertise with younger children, helping them master the four main strokes: freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly. 
    Wenhao believes that proper technique is the key to becoming a stronger swimmer and enjoys breaking down each stroke into manageable steps, allowing kids to build confidence and 
    improve their skills in the water.
